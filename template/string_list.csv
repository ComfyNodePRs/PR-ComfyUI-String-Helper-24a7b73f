"The image shows a woman sitting on a set of outdoor stairs. She is leaning back, her body angled slightly, with her left arm resting behind her and her right hand raised to her head as if she's adjusting her white headphones. She has black hair with bangs and is wearing a gray t-shirt, black shorts with a white belt, and black sheer tights. The stairs are made of gray stone, and there is a black metal railing on one side. In the background, there is a light-colored building with trees and some other vegetation. The lighting appears to be natural daylight. The camera is positioned at a medium distance and slightly below her level, capturing her from a slightly low angle. The focus is sharp on the woman and the immediate stairs around her, while the background is slightly less detailed, creating a sense of depth.",这张图片显示一位女性坐在户外的楼梯上。她身体略微倾斜地向后靠着，左臂放在身后，右手抬到头边，好像在调整她的白色耳机。她留着刘海的黑色头发，穿着灰色T恤、系着白色腰带的黑色短裤和黑色透明连裤袜。楼梯由灰色石头制成，一侧有黑色金属栏杆。背景中，有一栋浅色建筑，还有树木和其他植被。光线似乎是自然日光。相机位于中等距离，略低于她的水平，从略低的视角捕捉她的身影。焦点清晰地集中在女性和她周围的楼梯上，而背景的细节则略少，从而营造出一种深度感。,"休闲 (casual), 聆听音乐 (listening to music), 女孩 (girl), 街景 (street photography), 现代 (modern), 短发 (short hair), 休闲装 (casual wear), 时尚 (stylish), 户外 (outdoor), 简约 (minimalist)"
